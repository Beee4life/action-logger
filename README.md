# Action Logger

Welcome to the Action Logger plugin for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org). I built this initially for the IDF (International Downhill Federation), to keep tabs on actions from other users, but along the way I though many more users would find this interesting to use so that's why it's here now :)

It's not live yet, but the plugin does what it needs to do, except for a few minor flaws. If you 're interested, you can test drive the `develop` branch.

## Description 

This plugin gives you the option to log various actions on your website. Default there are a few actions which can be tracked from within WordPress' core and some from plugins I like/use.

### Loggable actions

#### WP core
* user registration
* user change
* user delete

#### Events manager
Next to that I included a few logging options for one of our favourite plugins: [Events Manager](http://wp-events-plugin.com/) + [Pro](https://eventsmanagerpro.com/). Right now you can track the following actions but more expected to follow:
* registration canceled
* registration rejected
* registration deleted
