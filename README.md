# Action Logger

Welcome to the Action Logger plugin for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org). I built this initially for the IDF (International Downhill Federation), to keep tabs on actions from other users, but along the way I though many more users would find this interesting to use so that's why it's here now :)

It's not live yet, but the plugin does what it needs to do, except for a few minor flaws. If you 're interested, you can test drive the `develop` branch.

## Description 

This plugin gives you the option to log various actions on your website. There are a few (core WP) actions which can be tracked but the power is that you can log anything you want by adding the logger somewhere in your code.

### Loggable actions

#### WP core
* user registration
* user change
* user delete
* post change
* post publish
* post delete
* post trash

V0.1 is not out yet, but if you're feeling frisky, check out the develop branch.
